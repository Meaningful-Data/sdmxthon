    "## Modelling\n",
    "Data modelling is better done through a user interface and persisting information into a database. SDMXThon is not providing either, and it does not intend to substitute or compete with proper tools for modelling purposes, like Fusion Metadata Registry.\n",
    "Still, SDMXTHon can provide some functionalities for quick prototyping, due to its simple API to explore and manipulate metadata, as well as the method to generate SDMX-ML messages for the data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection\n",
    "Data collection involves the reception and integration of data from multiple providers. SDMX enables automated data collection by providing standard formats to change metadata and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chart represents a typical collection process:\n",
    "\n",
    "![collection](images/collection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A system receives an SDMX data file. The file is read, so that the data are loaded, and the related structure is obtained. Once the structure of the data is known, it is possible to validate that the data are following their required structure. Finally, if data are structurally correct, the data in the instance shall be loaded into the collection database.\n",
    "SDMXThon provides support to all the steps in the use case, as demonstrated with the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "SDMXThon allows reading SDMX instances from stored files or from the web. It can also get as input a string or BytesIO object, facilitating integration if the data reception system is written in Python."

    "## Dissemination\n",
    "As with data modelling, data dissemination requires of a full system including data stored in databases and interfaces (GUIs and APIs). SDMXThon is not providing any of those, but can be used to develop a dissemination system in Python.\n",

    "Essentially, dissemination is the process of allowing users (human or machines) to request some data, with certain filters, and responding with the data required. To do this, it is necessary to have a system able to receive the request for data, get the data from the database, serialize them into the required format (SDMX), and serve the response.\n",
    "SDMXThon provides a simple interface to perform these tasks. Connection to most RDBMS is supported, which allows retrieving the required data. Once the data are loaded, the SDMX file is generated with a simple method, and can be passed as a file or StringIO to the serving system. In any case, such a dissemination system would need to be built, and it is not provided by SDMXThon.\n",
    "The other side of data dissemination is data analysis. Data are disseminated because some user are going to use this data for some analytical purpose (or to calculate new information to be analysed). Given that Pandas is one of the most relevant libraries for data science and data analysis, the simple interface SDMXThon is providing to retrieve the required data enables any data analyst with no or limited SDMX knowledge to benefit from all the functionalities SDMX offers.\n"
