The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. We work with governments to understand what drives economic, social and environmental change. We measure productivity and global flows of trade and investment. We analyse and compare data to predict future trends. We set international standards on a wide range of things, from agriculture and tax to the safety of chemicals. We look, too, at issues that directly affect the lives of ordinary people, like how much they pay in taxes and social security, and how much leisure time they can take. We compare how different countries’ school systems are readying their young people for modern life, and how different countries’ pension systems will look after their citizens in old age. Drawing on facts and real-life experience, we recommend policies designed to make the lives of ordinary people better. We work with business, through the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, and with labour, through the Trade Union Advisory Committee. We have active contacts as well with other civil society organisations. The common thread of our work is a shared commitment to market economies backed by democratic institutions and focused on the wellbeing of all citizens. Along the way, we also set out to make life harder for the terrorists, tax dodgers, crooked businessmen and others whose actions undermine a fair and open society.</com:Description></str:Agency><str:Agency id="METATECH" urn="urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.base.Agency=METATECH"><com:Name xml:lang="en">Metadata Technology</com:Name><com:Description xml:lang="en">Provider of consultancy, software, and services to the SDMX community.</com:Description><str:Contact><com:Name xml:lang="en">Chris Nelson</com:Name><str:Department xml:lang="en">Standards</str:Department><str:Role xml:lang="en">Standards Consultant</str:Role><str:Telephone>+44 1483 418058</str:Telephone><str:URI>http://www.metadatatechnology.com</str:URI><str:URI>http://www.sdmxfusion.com</str:URI><str:URI>http://registry.sdmxcloud.org</str:URI><str:URI>http://data.sdmxcloud.org</str:URI><str:Email>chris.nelson@metadatatechnology.com</str:Email></str:Contact><str:Contact><com:Name xml:lang="en">Matthew Nelson</com:Name><str:Department xml:lang="en">IT</str:Department><str:Role xml:lang="en">Software Architect</str:Role><str:Telephone>+44 1483 418058</str:Telephone><str:URI>http://sdmxsource.org</str:URI><str:Email>matt.nelson@metadatatechnology.com</str:Email></str:Contact></str:Agency><str:Agency id="ILO" urn="urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.base.Agency=ILO"><com:Name xml:lang="en">International Labour Organization</com:Name><com:Description xml:lang="en">The ILO was founded in 1919, in the wake of a destructive war, to pursue a vision based on the premise that universal, lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice.
