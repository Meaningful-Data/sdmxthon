        not all, statistical domains. SDMX recommends using these concepts whenever feasible in SDMX structures and
        messages to promote re-usability and exchange of statistical information and their related metadata between
        organizations. Whenever used, these concepts should conform to the specified names, roles, and representations

                    information correctly describes the phenomena. It is usually characterized in terms of error in
                    statistical estimates and is often decomposed into bias (systematic error) and variance (random
                    error) components. Accuracy can contain either measures of accuracy (numerical results of the
                    methods for assessing the accuracy of data) or qualitative assessment indicators. It may also be
                    described in terms of the major sources of error that potentially cause inaccuracy (e.g., coverage,
                    sampling, non response, response error). Accuracy is associated with the "reliability" of the data,
                    which is defined as the closeness of the initial estimated value to the subsequent estimated
                    value.This concept can be broken down into: "Accuracy - overall" (summary assessment); "Accuracy -
                    non-sampling error"; "Accuracy - sampling error".

                    statistical surveys using different methodology, statistics are often not completely identical, but
                    show differences in results due to different approaches, classifications and methodological
                    standards. There are several areas where the assessment of coherence is regularly conducted: between
                    provisional and final statistics, between annual and short-term statistics, between statistics from
                    the same socio-economic domain, and between survey statistics and national accounts.
                    The concept of coherence is closely related to the concept of comparability between statistical
                    domains. Both coherence and comparability refer to a data set with respect to another. The
                    difference between the two is that comparability refers to comparisons between statistics based on
                    usually unrelated statistical populations and coherence refers to comparisons between statistics for
                    the same or largely similar populations.
                    Coherence can be generally broken down into "Coherence - cross-domain" and "Coherence - internal".
                    Users should be aware that, in the Data Quality Assessment Framework of the International Monetary
                    Fund, the term "consistency" is used for indicating "logical and numerical coherence". In that
                    framework, "internal consistency" and "intersectoral and cross-domain consistency" can be mapped to
                    "internal coherence" and "cross-domain coherence" respectively.

                    statistical domain, based on stable or changing methodology (e.g. between provisional and final
                    statistics or between different reference years showing break in series) should be described.
                    Frequently, a group of statistics of a different type (in monetary value, in volume or constant
                    price, price indicators, etc) measure the same phenomenon using different methodologies. For
                    instance, statistics on employment, depending on whether they result from employers' declarations or
                    household surveys do not lead exactly to the same results. However, there are often differences in
                    the concepts used (de jure or de facto population, for instance), in the registration date, in the
                    cif/fob registration for external trade, etc. It is very important to check that these
                    representations do not diverge too much in order to anticipate users' questions and for preparing
                    corrective actions.

                <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Comparability aims at measuring the impact of differences in applied
                    statistical concepts and definitions on the comparison of statistics between geographical areas,
                    non-geographical dimensions, or over time. Comparability of statistics, i.e. their usefulness in
                    drawing comparisons and contrast among different populations, is a complex concept, difficult to
                    assess in precise or absolute terms. In general terms, it means that statistics for different
                    populations can be legitimately aggregated, compared and interpreted in relation to each other or
                    against some common standard. Metadata must convey such information that will help any interested
                    party in evaluating comparability of the data, which is the result of a multitude of factors.
                    In some quality frameworks, e.g. the European Statistics Code of Practice, comparability is strictly
                    associated with the coherence of statistics.
                    The concept can be further broken down into:
                    (a) Comparability - geographical, referring to the degree of comparability between statistics
                    measuring the same phenomenon for different geographical areas.
                    (b) Comparability over time, referring to the degree of comparability between two or more instances
                    of data on the same phenomenon measured at different points in time.
                    (c) Comparability between domains, referring to the comparability between different survey results
                    which target similar characteristics in different statistical domains.

                    characterised as confidential according to the relevant national or international legislation.
                    Unauthorised disclosure of data that are restricted or confidential is not permitted and even
                    legislative measures or other formal provisions may be used to prevent disclosure. Often, there are
                    procedures in place to prevent disclosure of restricted or confidential data, including rules
                    applying to staff, aggregation rules when disseminating data, provision of unit records, etc.
                    Sensitivity (of information) is sometimes used as a synonym to confidentiality.
                    This concept can be broken down into: Confidentiality - policy; Confidentiality - status;

                    for detecting and handling errors in data, also aiming at avoiding their future repetition. An
                    "edit" is the correction of an error in data. An "editing rule" is the specification of the
                    conditions under which edits are made.
                    Examples of different techniques include the different approaches to editing such as micro-editing/
                    macro-editing, input/output editing, or to the various tools available for editing such as graphical
                    editing, interactive editing, etc.
                    Edit types refer to the actual nature of edits applied to data during input or output processing.
                    These include:
                    - validation edits, to check the validity of basic identification of classificatory items in unit
                    data;
                    - logical edits, to ensure that two or more data items do not have contradictory values;
                    - consistency edits, to ensure that precise and correct arithmetic relationships exist between two
                    or more data items;
                    - range edits, identifying whether or not a data item value falls inside a determined acceptable
                    range;
                    - variance edits, looking for suspiciously high variances at the output edit stage.
                    Micro-editing and macro-editing may be distinguished in order to calculate rate of edits. Edit types
                    may also refer to whether these edits are fatal or query type, i.e. whether they detect errors with
                    certainty or point to suspicious data items.

                    observations, this interval determines the frequency of the series (e.g. monthly, quarterly,
                    yearly). "Frequency" - also called "periodicity" - may refer to several stages in the production
                    process, e.g. in data collection or in data dissemination (e.g. a time series could be available at
                    annual frequency but the underlying data are compiled monthly). Therefore, "Frequency" can be broken
                    down into "Frequency - data collection" and "Frequency - data dissemination".
                    For data messages, the frequency is represented through codes. Any additional detail needed (e.g.
                    "weekly on Thursday") must be inserted as free text within "Frequency detail".

                <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Occupation refers to the type of work done during the reference period
                    by the person employed (or the type of work done previously, if the person is unemployed),
                    irrespective of the industry or the status in employment in which the person should be classified.
                    Occupation is defined in terms of jobs or posts. "Job" is defined by the International Labour
                    Organisation (ILO) as a set of tasks and duties executed, or meant to be executed, by one person. A
                    set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterised by a high degree of similarity constitutes
                    an occupation. Persons are classified by occupation through their relationship to a past, present or
                    future job. The international standard for classification of occupations is the International
                    Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). Therefore the concept is normally coded, i.e.
                    represented through a code list.

                    light on the issues that are important to users. Assessing relevance is subjective and depends upon
                    the varying needs of users. The agency's challenge is to weigh and balance the conflicting needs of
                    current and potential users to produce statistics that satisfy the most important needs within given
                    resource constraints. In assessing relevance, one approach is to gauge relevance directly, by
                    polling users about the data. Indirect evidence of relevance may be found by ascertaining where
                    there are processes in place to determine the uses of data and the views of their users or to use
                    the data in-house for research and other analysis. Relevance refers to the processes for monitoring
                    the relevance and practical usefulness of existing statistics in meeting users' needs and how these
                    processes impact the development of statistical programmes.
                    This concept can be broken down into: "Relevance - completeness"; "Relevance - user needs";
                    "Relevance - user satisfaction".

<com:Description xml:lang="en">The Cross Domain Concept Scheme (starting from v2.0) is created from the set of
    concepts in the SDMX Glossary, which is an SDMX guideline containing concepts and related definitions that are
    useful for building and understanding data and metadata exchange arrangements based on SDMX. The Glossary
    provides definition of terms found in the SDMX Information Model, Data Structure Definitions (DSDs) and Metadata
    Structure Definitions (MSDs) at the time of the present release. It is recommended as a single entry point to a
    common SDMX terminology to be used in order to facilitate communication and understanding of the standard.In
    short, the overall message of the glossary is the following: if a term is used, then its precise meaning should
    correspond to the SDMX Glossary definition, and any reference to a particular phenomenon described in the SDMX
    Glossary should use the appropriate term.Version 1.0 of the SDMX Glossary, which replaces the Metadata Common
    Vocabulary (MCV) published in 2009, was finalised in February 2016. The Cross Domain Concept Scheme v1.0 was
    created from the MCV concepts.For any question, comment or correction, feel free to contact the SDMX Statistical
    Working Group (SWG) at the following address: swg@sdmx.org.

                information correctly describes the phenomena. It is usually characterised in terms of error in
                statistical estimates and is often decomposed into bias (systematic error) and variance (random
                error) components. Accuracy can be expressed as either measures of accuracy (numerical results of
                the methods for assessing the accuracy of data) or qualitative assessment indicators. It may also be
                described in terms of the major sources of error that potentially cause inaccuracy (e.g., coverage,
                sampling, non-response, response error). Accuracy is associated with the "reliability" of the data,
                which is defined as the closeness of the initial estimated value to the subsequent estimated value.

                maintenance agencies. Each maintenance agency can have a single agency scheme, and may have none.
                The agencies in the agency scheme are deemed to be sub agencies of the maintenance agency of the
                scheme in which they reside. The top-level agency scheme is the scheme for which SDMX is the
                maintenance agency (SDMX agency scheme), and every agency in every agency scheme must be related
                directly or indirectly via intervening agency schemes, to an agency registered in the SDMX agency
                scheme. In this way each agency can be identified uniquely by the combination of agencies in the
                path from the SDMX agency scheme to the agency scheme in which it resides, plus its own identity in
                that scheme.

                use these in any way and any combination they wish. An Annotation can only be processed in a

                value for the entire data set. Some metadata concepts (e.g. frequency) may not be meaningful at the
                observation level, but only when applied to a higher level (e.g. to a time series of observations).
                Time, on the other hand, is meaningful at observation level, because every observation is associated
                with a specific point or period in time. Data Structure Definitions and Metadata Structure
                Definitions provide information about the level at which a particular concept descriptor is

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">The SDMX technical standards are sufficiently generic to allow
                institutions to adopt and implement any specific representation. However, the use of common code
                lists will facilitate users to work even more efficiently as it eases the maintenance of, and
                reduces the need for, mapping systems and interfaces delivering data and metadata to users.
                Therefore, a choice over code lists has a great impact on the efficiency of data sharing. From
                version 2.1 of the standard it is possible to exchange and disseminate a partial code list which is
                extracted from the full code list and which supports the dimension values valid for a particular
                Data Structure Definition (DSD). The content of the partial code list is specified on a Constraint
                and can be specified for any object to which a Constraint may be attached. This makes it possible to
                use common (and often quite large) Code Lists in multiple DSDs and then to limit their content for
                use in a specific DSD.

            <com:AnnotationType>CONTEXT</com:AnnotationType>
            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">When originating from different sources, and in particular from
                statistical surveys using different methodology, statistics are often not completely identical, but
                show differences in results due to different collection methodology concepts, classifications and
                methodological standards. There are several areas where the assessment of coherence is regularly
                conducted: between provisional and final statistics, between annual and short-term statistics,
                between statistics from the same socio-economic domain, and between survey statistics and national
                accounts. The concept of coherence is closely related to the concept of comparability between
                statistical domains. Both coherence and comparability refer to a data set with respect to another.
                The difference between the two is that comparability refers to comparisons between statistics based
                on usually unrelated statistical populations and coherence refers to comparisons between statistics
                for the same or largely similar populations. In the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) of the
                International Monetary Fund, the term "consistency" is used for indicating "logical and numerical
                coherence". In that framework, "internal consistency" and "intersectoral and cross-domain
                consistency" can be mapped to "internal coherence" and "cross-domain coherence" respectively.

                methodology (e.g. between provisional and final statistics or between different reference years

                in volume or constant price, price indicators, etc.) measure the same phenomenon using different
                methodologies. For instance, statistics on employment, depending on whether they result from
                employers' declarations or household surveys do not lead exactly to the same results. However, there
                are often differences in the concepts used (de-jure or de-facto population, for instance), in the
                registration date, in the cif/fob registration for external trade, etc. It is very important to
                check that these representations do not diverge too much in order to anticipate users' questions and
                for preparing corrective actions.

                contain a descriptive text which can be attached to any construct specified in the Attribute
                Relationship. In metadata sets a comment can be attached to any object in the SDMX Information Model
                that can be identified (known as an "Identifiable Artefact" in the model). For example Agency,
                Provision Agreement, Dataflow, Code, Concept. In both of these types of messages the relevant
                Concept (e.g. COMMENT) must be declared in the structure definition (Data Structure Definition or
                Metadata Structure Definition) together with the object to which it is allowed to be attached in the
                data set or metadata set. Note that in a data structure (version 2.1 onwards) it is possible to
                define the "attribute relationship" of any Concept used as an Attribute to more than one of data
                set, group, series, observation. This is not possible using V 2.0. In version 2.0 it is necessary to
                declare multiple Concepts (e.g. CONCEPT_SERIES, CONCEPT_OBS) to achieve this.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Comparability aims at measuring the impact of differences in applied
                statistical concepts and definitions on the comparison of statistics between geographical areas,
                non-geographical dimensions, or over time. Comparability of statistics, i.e. their usefulness in
                drawing comparisons and contrast among different populations, is a complex concept, difficult to
                assess in precise or absolute terms. In general terms, it means that statistics for different
                populations can be legitimately aggregated, compared and interpreted in relation to each other or
                against some common standard. Metadata must convey such information that will help any interested
                party in evaluating comparability of the data, which is the result of a multitude of factors. In
                some quality assurance frameworks, e.g. the European Statistics Code of Practice, comparability is
                strictly associated with the coherence of statistics.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">At an abstract level, a Concept is defined in the Generic Statistical
                Information Model (GSIM) as a "unit of thought differentiated by characteristics". Concepts are used
                in different ways throughout the statistical lifecycle, and each role of a Concept is described
                using different information objects (which are subtypes of Concept). A Concept can be used in these
                situations: (a) As a characteristic. The Concept is used by a Variable to describe the particular
                characteristic that is to be measured about a Population. For example, to measure the Concept of
                gender in a population of adults in the Netherlands, the Variable combines this Concept with the
                Unit Type "person". (b) As a Unit Type or a Population. To describe the set of objects that
                information is to be obtained about in a statistical survey. For example, the Population of adults
                in Netherlands based on the Unit Type of persons. (c) As a Category to further define details about
                a Concept. For example, Male and Female for the Concept of Gender. Codes can be linked to a Category
                via a Node (i.e., a Code Item or Classification Item), for use within a Code List or Statistical
                Classification. In SDMX the concept can be given a Core Representation such as a reference to a code
                list for an enumerated representation or other values such as "integer" or "string" for a
                non-enumerated representation. This representation can be overridden in the data structure when the
                concept is used as a dimension or attribute. A concept with a core representation could be regarded
                as a represented variable.

                scheme to be used both for data structures and metadata structures. A core representation of each
                concept can be specified (e.g. a code list, or other representations such as "date").

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Data are protected by confidentiality in cases where unauthorised
                disclosure could be prejudicial or harmful to the interest of the source or other relevant parties.
                For instance, data allowing the identification of a physical or legal person, either directly or
                indirectly, may be characterised as confidential according to the relevant national or international
                legislation. Unauthorised disclosure of data that are restricted or confidential is not permitted
                and even legislative measures or other formal provisions may be used to prevent disclosure. Often,
                there are procedures in place to prevent disclosure of restricted or confidential data, including
                rules applying to staff, aggregation rules when disseminating data, provision of unit records, etc.

                (businesses, institutions, households, individuals) imposed by a statistical obligation. The overall
                burden of delivering the information depends on: a) the number of respondents; b) the average time
                required to provide the information, including time spent after receipt of the questionnaire
                ("recontact time"); and c) the hourly cost of a respondent's time.

            <com:AnnotationType>CONTEXT</com:AnnotationType>
            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">1) Potential application across all statistical domains. Examples:
                CL_OBS_STATUS, CL_CONF_STATUS, CL_DECIMALS, CL_UNIT_MULT, CL_AREA. Explanatory note: Key term for
                this criterion is "potential". These code lists must not necessarily be implemented in all Data
                Structure Definitions (DSDs) but they potentially could. For example, code list "Unit multiplier"
                could possibly be used in all implementations dealing with statistical figures but some
                implementations might not see the need for such a dimension because the statistical values do not
                require it, e.g. average number of children per household. Inversely, in this example a code list
                for decimals will be absolutely necessary. 2) Code lists maintained by the SWG on its initiative
                because 1) they are intended for broad use within the SDMX community and 2) there is a strong need
                for harmonisation across domains which are not necessarily closely connected with each other.
                Examples for case 1: CL_AGE, CL_CIVIL_STATUS, CL_FREQ, CL_TIME_FORMAT, CL_SEX, CL_ADJUSTMENT.
                Explanatory note: By proposing such code lists it is hoped to promote harmonisation across domains
                and provide ready-to-use artefacts to implementers. Example for case 2: CL_ACTIVITY. Explanatory
                note: International activity classifications are typically used in different statistical domains
                (e.g. economic versus social statistics). Without an established CDCL made available in centralised
                registries, the risk is that one domain develops a code list without taking into account the fact
                that other domains might use the same classification system. 3) Code lists recommended as CDCL by

                value added by the SWG is to propose guidelines on specific methodological issues, e.g. how to code
                a country that has been split into several new entities.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">In SDMX, data sets are reported or disseminated according to a data
                flow definition. The data flow definition identifies the data structure definition and may be
                associated with one or more subject-matter domains. This facilitates the search for data according
                to organised category schemes. A "Dataflow", in this context, is an abstract concept of the data
                sets, i.e. a structure without any data. While a data structure definition defines dimensions,
                attributes, measures and associated representation that comprise the valid structure of data and
                related metadata contained in a data set, the Dataflow definition associates a data structure
                definition with one or more category. This gives a system the ability to state which data sets are
                to be reported for a given category and which data sets can be reported using the data structure
                definition. The Dataflow definition may also have additional metadata attached, defining qualitative
                information and constraints on the use of the data structure definition, in terms of reporting
                periodicity or specifying the subset of codes to be used in a dimension.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">In SDMX a Data Provider Scheme contains a non-hierarchic list of data
                providers. Each maintenance agency can have a single data provider scheme, and may have none. The
                identity of the data provider is a combination of the identity of the data provider scheme (which
                includes the maintenance agency) in which it resides and the identity of the data provider in that
                scheme. The Data Provider is the owning organisation of data and reference metadata. These data and
                reference metadata are reported, exchanged, or disseminated as SDMX data sets and SDMX metadata
                sets. The type of data and metadata that are available are specified in a Dataflow and Metadataflow.
                The union of one data provider and one Dataflow or Metadataflow is known as a Provision Agreement.
                In a data collection scenario the data provider is the organisation reporting the data or reference
                metadata and information can be linked with the provision agreement. Information linked to the
                provision agreement can specify where the data or reference metadata are located (data registration)
                and the data collector (as the Agency of the provision agreement) can specify validation Constraints
                such as allowable dimension values or series keys for which data can be reported. In a data
                dissemination scenario information linked to the provision agreement can specify the location of the
                data source and the content of the data source in terms of series keys available (Constraint).

                format allows the representation of data structured according to a specific data structure
                definition; - SDMX-EDI Data Set: a specific case of generic using the UN/EDIFACT syntax and which
                has limitations on what can be represented. It supports time series only. The Structure Specific
                format is new to SDMX version 2.1 and combines the functionalities of the version 2.0 Compact and

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">A DSD defines the structure of an organised collection of data (Data
                Set) by means of concepts with specific roles, and their representation. In order to exchange or
                disseminate statistical information, an institution needs to specify which statistical concepts are
                necessary for identifying the series (and for use as dimensions) and which statistical concepts are
                to be used as attributes and measures. These definitions form the data structure definition. In a
                data collection scenario the specification of the data structure definition is often a collaborative
                venture between the collecting institution and its partners. There are three types of construct in
                the DSD: Dimension, Attribute, and Measure. Each of these combines a Concept with its representation
                (this can be either a reference to a Code list or a non-coded data type such as "integer", "string",
                "date/time"). The roles of the three types of construct (Dimension, Attribute, and Measure) are as
                follows: A Dimension is an identifying component, sometimes referred to as a "classificatory
                variable". When a value is given to each of the Dimensions in a data set (this is often called a
                "key" or a "series") the resulting key, when combined with a time value, uniquely identifies an
                observation. For instance, country, indicator, measurement unit, frequency, and time dimensions
                together identify the cells in a cross-country time series with multiple indicators (for example,
                gross domestic product, gross domestic debt) measured in different units (for example, various
                currencies, percent changes) and at different frequencies (for example, annual, quarterly). The
                cells in such a multi-dimensional table contain the observation values. The DSD construct that
                specifies the Concept and expected representation of an observation is called a Measure. The
                semantics of the measure are derived from the Dimensions or a sub set of them and, if not specified
                in a Dimension, an Attribute indicating the measurement unit e.g. indicator and measure unit (gross
                domestic product percentage change). Additional metadata that are useful for understanding or
                processing the observed value or the context of data set or series are called an Attribute in the
                DSD. Examples of an attribute are a note on the observation, a confidentiality status, or the unit
                of measure used, or the Title of a series.

                of the ownership group; 2) DSDs labelled as "global" by the SDMX sponsors considering the recognised
                expertise in the domain concerned of one of the organisations represented in the ownership group and
                the potential usefulness of the artefact for the whole SDMX community; in this case the DSD will
                have to meet strict criteria of versioning, governance, maintenance, adoption and endorsement.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">This concept is typically used in the SNA (System of National
                Accounts) where transactions are first analysed according to their nature, then, for certain sectors
                or kind of transactions, from the expenditure side, by purpose, answering the question "for what
                purpose"?. The classifications supporting this concept are the following: Classification of the
                functions of government (COFOG); Classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP);
                Classification of the purposes of non-profit institutions serving households (COPNI), and;
                Classification of outlays of producers by purpose (COPP). The main purpose of these classifications
                is to provide statistics which experience has shown to be of general interest for a wide variety of
                analytical uses. For example, COICOP shows items such as household expenditure on food, health and
                education services all of which are important indicators of national welfare; COFOG shows government
                expenditure on health, education, defence and so on and is also used to distinguish between
                collective services and individual consumption goods and services provided by government.

                process, e.g. in data collection or in data dissemination. (e.g., a time series could be available

                partners agree on providing access to their data directly from their database according to standard
                processes, formats and technologies (e.g. web service). From the data management point of view, the
                hub is also based on a pre-specified datasets, which are not kept locally at the central hub system.
                The query process operates as follows: 1. A user identifies a dataset through the graphical user
                interface (GUI) of the hub using the structural metadata, and requests it; 2. the hub translates the
                user request in one or more queries and sends them to the related data providers' systems; 3. data
                providers' systems process the query and send the result to the hub in standard format (e.g. SDMX-ML
                2.1); 4. the hub puts together all the results originated in all implicated data providers' systems
                and presents them in the requested format. This could be a human-readable, non-SDMX format such as a
                table.

                Information Model. These can be structural objects such as Dataflow, Code, Concept or data set
                objects such as partial keys (e.g. the value of a specific Dimension such as a country in the
                context of the data set) or even observations. These metadata need to be managed and made accessible
                not only to systems disseminating the metadata but often also to systems concerned with data
                discovery, query, and data visualisation. Many dissemination systems unite the reference metadata
                with the data to which they pertain, even though these metadata are collected by different
                mechanisms, by different systems, and stored in different databases from the data.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">In SDMX the metadata set must conform to the specification in a
                Metadata Structure Definition. The metadata set contains one or more reports, each report comprising
                the metadata content (a set of attributes and corresponding content), and the identification of the
                precise object to which the metadata are to be attached. The metadata can be attached to any SDMX
                artefact that can be identified (e.g. structural artefact such as a code, concept, dimension or a
                part of a data set such as a partial series key or observation). In SDMX the type of report defined
                in a Metadata Structure Definition is known as "reference metadata" which are typified by quality
                metadata but can contain any type of metadata. These metadata are generally not reported with the
                data (as data attributes in a data set) and are often collected to a different schedule to the data,
                are derived from separate (from the data) repositories and collected from/reported by systems
                different from the statistical data warehouse.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Non-response errors result from a failure to collect complete
                information on all units in the selected sample. These are known as "unit non-response" and "item
                non-response". Non-response errors affect survey results in two ways. First, the decrease in sample
                size or in the amount of information collected in response to a particular question results in
                larger standard errors. Second, and perhaps more important, a bias is introduced to the extent that
                non-respondents differ from respondents within a selected sample. Non-response errors are determined
                by collecting any or all of the following: unit response rate, weighted unit response rate, item
                response rate, item coverage rate, refusal rate, distribution of reason for non-response, comparison
                of data across contacts, link to administrative data for non- respondents, estimate of non-response
                bias (Statistical Policy Working Paper 15: Quality in Establishment Surveys, Office of Management
                and Budget, Washington D.C., July 1988, page 68).

                defects in the sampling frame, faulty demarcation of sample units, defects in the selection of
                sample units, mistakes in the collection of data due to personal variations, misunderstanding, bias,
                negligence or dishonesty on the part of the investigator or of the interviewer, mistakes at the
                stage of the processing of the data, etc. Non-sampling errors may be categorised as:- Coverage
                errors (or frame errors) due to divergences between the target population and the frame population;
                - Measurement errors occurring during data collection; - Nonresponse errors caused by no data
                collected for a population unit or for some survey variables; - Processing errors due to errors
                introduced during data entry, data editing, sometimes coding and imputation; - Model assumption
                errors.

                set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterised by a high degree of similarity constitutes
                an occupation. Persons are classified by occupation through their relationship to a past, present or
                future job. The international standard for classification of occupations is the International
                Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). Therefore the concept is normally coded.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">In SDMX an Organisation Unit Scheme comprises a flat or hierarchical
                list of organisation units. Each maintenance agency can have multiple organisation unit schemes, and
                may have none. The identity of the organisation unit is a combination of the identity of the
                organisation unit scheme (which includes the maintenance agency) in which it resides and the
                identity of the organisation unit in that scheme. The Organisation Unit plays no direct role in
                support of the functionality of SDMX systems as documented in the technical standards (whereas
                Agency, Data Provider, and Data Consumer do play a distinct role). Therefore, this type of
                organisation can play any role and have any behaviour that is internal to the systems that use it.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Various economic aggregates (e.g. GDP, investment, household
                consumption) are calculated so that changes in value terms can be divided up into a factor that
                reflects the underlying price changes and a factor which reflects the volume changes. As a result of
                this sub-division, one can get an idea of how these aggregates develop after adjustment for price
                changes. For example, in order to measure the volume growth of GDP and its components, it is
                therefore necessary to remove the effect of price changes from the changes in value, by keeping
                prices "constant" as it were.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">In many cases, the reference period and time period will be identical,
                but there are also cases where they are different. This can happen if data are not available for the
                target reference period, but are available for a time period which is judged to be sufficiently
                close. For example, the reference period may be a calendar year, whereas data may only be available
                for a fiscal year. In such cases, "reference period" should refer to the target reference period
                rather than the actual time period of the data. The difference between target and actual reference
                period can be highlighted in a free text note.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Relevance is concerned with whether the available information sheds
                light on the issues that are important to users. Assessing relevance is subjective and depends upon
                the varying needs of users. The Agency's challenge is to weight and balance the conflicting needs of
                current and potential users to produce statistics that satisfy the most important needs within given
                resource constraints. In assessing relevance, one approach is to gauge relevance directly, by
                polling users about the data. Indirect evidence of relevance may be found by ascertaining where
                there are processes in place to determine the uses of data and the views of their users or to use
                the data in-house for research and other analysis. Relevance refers to the processes for monitoring
                the relevance and practical usefulness of existing statistics in meeting users' needs and how these
                processes impact the development of statistical programmes.

                are available compared to what should be available. For producers, It can be used to evaluate the
                degree of compliance by a given Member State for a given dataset and period. For users, it can be
                used to: identify whether important variables are missing for some individual Member State or
                alternatively; give users an overall measurement (aggregate across countries and/or key variables)
                of the availability of statistics. The indicator should be accompanied by information about which
                variables are missing and the reasons for incompleteness as well as, where relevant, the impact of
                the missing data on aggregates, and plans for improving completeness in the future.

                GESMES (Generic Statistical Message) is a United Nations standard (EDIFACT message) allowing partner
                institutions to exchange statistical multi-dimensional arrays in a generic but standardised way.
                GESMES/TS (TS stands for "time series" and the specification is limited to supporting time series
                data) is an Implementation Guide specifying the use of GESMES for time series data and related
                metadata, and structural metadata - it can be regarded as a profile of GESMES. In the SDMX standard
                the GESMES/TS profile is known as SDMX-EDI. It defines the structures of GESMES that are available
                for use in SDMX-EDI thus allowing partner institutions to design and to build the applications

                Settlements, European Central Bank, Eurostat, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic
                Co-operation and Development, United Nations Statistical Division and World Bank) to facilitate the
                exchange of statistical data and metadata using information technologies. This standard provides an
                integrated approach to facilitating statistical data and metadata exchange, enabling interoperable
                implementations within and between systems concerned with the exchange, reporting and dissemination
                of statistical data and their related meta-information. It is not just a format for data exchange:
                it includes a set of technical standards and content-oriented guidelines, and is supported by an IT
                architecture and tools to be used for the efficient exchange and sharing of statistical data and
                metadata. Taken together, those elements may be used to support improved business processes for any
                statistical organisation.

                bearer of statistical characteristics. These units can, in turn, be divided into observation units
                and analytical units. Statistical units for economic statistics are defined on the basis of three
                criteria: 1) Legal, accounting or organisational criteria; 2) Geographical criteria; 3) Activity
                criteria. Statistical units comprise the enterprise, enterprise group, kind-of-activity unit (KAU),
                local unit, establishment, homogeneous unit of production, persons, households, geographical areas,
                events etc. Statistical units can be categorised into basic statistical units, i.e. those for which
                data are collected, and derived statistical units, i.e. those which are constructed during the
                statistical production process. A basic statistical unit is the most detailed level to which the
                obtained characteristics can be attached.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Timeliness refers to the speed of data availability, whether for
                dissemination or for further processing, and it is measured with respect to the time lag between the
                end of the reference period and the release of data. Timeliness is a crucial element of data
                quality: adequate timeliness corresponds to a situation where policy-makers can take informed
                decisions in time for achieving the targeted results. In quality assessment, timeliness is often
                associated with punctuality, which refers to the time lag between the release date of data and the
                target date announced in some official release calendar.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">The unit of measure is a quantity or increment by which something is
                counted or described, such as kg, mm, C, F, monetary units such as Euro or US dollar, simple number
                counts or index numbers. The unit of measure has a type (e.g. currency) and, in connection with the
                unit multiplier, provides the level of detail for the value of the variable. For data messages, the
                concept is usually represented by codes. For metadata messages the concept is usually represented by
                free text.

            <com:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">Standard national accounts valuations include the basic price (what
                the seller receives) and the purchaser's price (what the purchaser pays). The purchaser's price is
                the basic price, plus taxes less subsidies on products, plus invoiced transportation and insurance
                services, plus distribution margin. Other valuation bases may be used in other contexts.
                International trade in goods considers the free on board (fob) price and cost-insurance-freight
                price, among others. The concept refers to valuation rules used for recording flows and stocks,
                including how consistent the practices used are with internationally accepted standards, guidelines,
                or good practices.
