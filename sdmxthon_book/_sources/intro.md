## SDMXThon use cases introduction

SDMXThon is an open-source Python library to manage SDMX Data and Metadata. It intends to provide a simple and effective way to integrate SDMX functionalities into Python.

SDMXThon provides simple APIs to read SDMX data into Pandas data frames, and to generate SDMX files from Pandas data frames. SDMXThon benefits from all the interfaces that Pandas has already built-in, which makes it a very powerful tool to integrate SDMX in already existing pipelines.

SDMXThon uses the version 2.1 of the Standard. Upgrade to version 3 will be done when the version of the standard will be more widely used.
